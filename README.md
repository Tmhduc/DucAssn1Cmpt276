# DucAssn1Cmpt276
 - Project name: DucCalculateGrade
 - I build this project as an assignment for my course CMPT 276 - Introduction to Software Engineering
 - I build a website where it lets users calculate their grades It performs basic operations such as giving back the mean grade, and the weighted grade of total grades.
 - There is also a button where it lets users to add more activities.
 - I learned how to use all the required tools to make such sites. I used SpringBoot to get the framework to work with. I used HTMl to build the interface for the webpage and JavaScript to perform underlying operatioins. I style my webpage using CSS. At the end, I use render to deploy my project onto the server side.
 - In the future, I am planning to take this project as an inspiration to add more features and make it more user-friendly.
 - One main problem I have is with deploying using Render. As Render not supporting java 22, I create a new maven project using java 17 and push it onto this current reprository. I will include my old reprository which uses java 22.
